<div class="slide">
    <h1 class="title">Confession time</h1>

    <p>This entire presentation is created using web components and a little black magic I wrote for myself.</p>

    <p>You can see the slides on <a href="https://calebdwilliams.github.io/ThunderPlainsJS">GitHub Pages</a> or follow read the code on <a href="https://github.com/calebdwilliams/ThunderPlainsJS">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <p>This is not a perfect implementation, but it should serve to show you what's possible using Web Components.</p>
